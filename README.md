## 100 Days Of Code Challenge (21st September 2020 - 30th December 2020)
> The challenge to code at least one hour every day for the next 100 days.
Original 100 Days idea was proposed by Alexander Kallaway - [Official Website](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) and [Medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)

## Motivation

> I've decided to take the 100 days of code challenge because I want to develop a coding study routine and improve my tech skills. I love computing and I believe the #100DaysOfCode challenge will help me to become a better programmer!   
(But here is a tweak - No posts ðŸ˜³) 

## Commitment
> I will try be as consistent as possible in my attempt to code daily for the next 100 days. 

## Goals

- [x] Code daily
- [x] Expand portfolio - problem solving/technical skills
- [x] Complete as many problems, courses, certifications & projects as possible
